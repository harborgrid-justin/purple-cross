| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| GraphQL migration complexity | Medium | High | Start with REST, add GraphQL gradually |
| BullMQ learning curve | Low | Medium | Good documentation, simple implementation |
| Workflow engine scope creep | High | High | MVP first, iterate based on feedback |
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Load testing, monitoring, gradual rollout |
| Redis scaling issues | Low | Medium | Redis Cluster if needed |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| User adoption resistance | Medium | High | Training, change management, phased rollout |
| Development delays | Medium | Medium | Buffer time, agile approach, prioritization |

## License Considerations

**Twenty CRM License**: AGPL-3.0

### What This Means
- ‚úÖ **Study and learn** from architecture (fully legal)
- ‚úÖ **Reimplement patterns** in your own code (clean-room implementation)
- ‚úÖ **Use ideas and concepts** (not copyrightable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Direct code copying** requires AGPL compliance (must open-source)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SaaS usage** triggers AGPL requirements (must provide source)

### Recommendation
**Approach**: Learn and reimplement, don't copy

All code examples in implementation guides are original implementations inspired by Twenty's patterns, not direct copies. This approach:
1. Avoids AGPL compliance requirements
2. Allows proprietary Purple Cross codebase
3. Enables customization for veterinary needs
4. Maintains legal compliance

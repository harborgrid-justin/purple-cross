# Detailed Software Engineering Migration & Implementation Plan

## Executive Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan for migrating architectural patterns and features from Twenty CRM into the Purple Cross veterinary practice management platform. This plan focuses on **adapting** patterns to our existing Express/Prisma architecture rather than wholesale code copying.

**Target**: Implement 7 high-priority features over 4 phases (9 months)  
**Approach**: Clean-room reimplementation with Purple Cross patterns  
**License Compliance**: All code will be original, inspired by Twenty's architecture

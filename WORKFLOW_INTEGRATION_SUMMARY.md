# Workflow Integration Summary - PR #70 Continuation

## Overview

This PR continues the work from PR #70 by integrating the workflow automation system with domain services throughout the application. The workflow system can now be triggered automatically by domain events, enabling powerful event-driven automation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Workflow Trigger Service

**File:** `backend/src/services/workflow-trigger.service.ts`

- Listens to domain events
- Automatically finds workflow templates configured with matching event triggers
- Executes workflows when events occur
- Handles multiple workflows for the same event
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Created Domain Events Service

**File:** `backend/src/services/domain-events.service.ts`

- Unified event emission service
- Single point for triggering both webhooks AND workflows
- Consistent event handling across the system
- Simplified service integration

### 3. Integrated Domain Services

Modified 8 domain services to emit events:

1. **PatientService** - patient.created, patient.updated, patient.deleted
2. **ClientService** - client.created, client.updated, client.deleted  
3. **AppointmentService** - appointment.created, appointment.updated, appointment.cancelled, appointment.completed
4. **InvoiceService** - invoice.created, invoice.paid, invoice.overdue
5. **MedicalRecordService** - medical_record.created, medical_record.updated
6. **LabTestService** - lab_test.ordered, lab_test.completed
7. **PrescriptionService** - prescription.created, prescription.refilled

**Total:** 13 distinct domain events

### 4. Enhanced Service Methods

Added new methods to trigger specific events:

- `InvoiceService.markInvoiceAsPaid()` - Triggers invoice.paid event
- `InvoiceService.markInvoiceAsOverdue()` - Triggers invoice.overdue event
- `LabTestService.completeLabTest()` - Triggers lab_test.completed event
- `PrescriptionService.refillPrescription()` - Triggers prescription.refilled event

### 5. Updated Constants

**File:** `backend/src/constants/index.ts`

Added `WORKFLOW_EVENTS` constant with all 13 event types, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

### 6. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**Files:**
- `WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for using event-driven workflows
- `WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### 7. Added Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/services/workflow-integration.test.ts`

- Tests domain events service
- Verifies event emission to both webhook and workflow systems
- Tests event data structure
- Validates all event types

## Event Flow Example

When a patient is created:

1. **PatientService.createPatient()** calls `domainEvents.emit('patient.created', data)`
2. **Domain Events Service** broadcasts to:
   - Webhook Events Service → Queues webhook deliveries
   - Workflow Trigger Service → Finds matching workflow templates
3. **Workflow Trigger Service** queries for templates where:
   - `triggerType = 'event'`
   - `triggerConfig.event = 'patient.created'`
   - `isActive = true`
4. **Workflow Engine** executes each matching template:
   - Processes actions sequentially or in parallel
   - Passes event data as workflow variables
   - Handles errors and logs results

## Use Cases

### 1. Welcome Email Workflow
**Trigger:** `patient.created`
```
Actions:
1. Wait 10 minutes
2. Send welcome email to owner
3. Create reminder for first checkup
```

### 2. Appointment Reminder
**Trigger:** `appointment.created`
```
Actions:
1. Wait until 24 hours before appointment
2. Send email reminder
3. Send SMS (if phone number exists)
```

### 3. Overdue Invoice Follow-up
**Trigger:** `invoice.overdue`
```
Actions:
1. Send overdue notice
2. Create task for billing team (parallel)
3. Update client payment status (parallel)
```

### 4. Lab Results Notification
**Trigger:** `lab_test.completed`
```
Actions:
1. Check if results are abnormal (condition)
2. If yes: Send urgent notification to vet
3. If yes: Schedule follow-up appointment
```

## Migration from PR #70

PR #70 provided:
- Visual workflow builder UI (React Flow)
- Workflow engine with parallel execution
- 7 action types
- Template management
- Manual workflow execution

This PR adds:
- **Automatic event-driven triggers**
- **Domain service integration**
- **Unified webhook + workflow events**
- **13 domain events**
- **Enhanced service methods**

## Configuration

### Creating an Event-Driven Workflow

1. **In Frontend:** Navigate to Integrations → Workflow Builder
2. **Add Actions:** Drag actions from the palette
3. **Configure Actions:** Set properties for each action
4. **Save Template:** Click "Save Template"
5. **Set Trigger:**
   - Trigger Type: `event`
   - Trigger Config: `{ "event": "patient.created" }`
6. **Activate:** Ensure template is marked as Active

### Monitoring Workflows

- **View Executions:** Integrations → Workflow Templates → Select Template
- **Check Logs:** Backend logs show workflow triggers and execution
- **Debug Failures:** Execution details include error messages

## Performance Considerations

- **Asynchronous Execution:** Workflows execute in background (BullMQ)
- **No Request Blocking:** Domain service methods return immediately
- **Parallel Actions:** Actions marked parallel execute concurrently
- **Error Isolation:** Failed workflows don't affect domain operations
- **Retry Logic:** Workflow engine supports action retry

## Security

- **Data Validation:** Event data validated before emission
- **Access Control:** Workflow templates respect user permissions
- **Audit Trail:** All executions logged with timestamps
- **Error Handling:** Sensitive data not exposed in error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard** - Live workflow execution view
2. **Advanced Scheduling** - Cron-based triggers
3. **Workflow Analytics** - Performance metrics and insights
4. **A/B Testing** - Test workflow variations
5. **Template Marketplace** - Share and import community workflows
6. **Sub-workflows** - Nested workflow execution
7. **External Integrations** - More third-party services
